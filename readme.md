# Baby Developmental Massage Courses Website

Peter Walker is widely respected and well-known as a teacher of Developmental Baby Massage. Peter has over 40 years experience in giving mother and baby massage groups. His certificated teacher training courses for Developmental Baby Massage are enjoyed by health visitors, nursery nurses, midwives, massage and many other therapists working with mothers and babies.
Criarte is a project about Yoga and events of artistic and pedagogical expression with couples, pregnant women, babies, children, their families and professionals who accompany them.
Peter and Criarte joined forces to make Baby Developmental Massage Courses availabe in Portugal, and this website intends to become an infomation hub about this organization, and promote these events to the local target audience (even though everything is in english for evaluation purposes) and the online events to a global audience.

## UX

This website is made for moms and health professionals. The vast majority of users will be woman, so the color palette chosen is more appealing to the feminine side.

At this stage of development I focused on static elements of information about the courses, so the UI is designed to make all the items very accessible. For most of it the user only needs 1 or 2 clicks to get what he wants, whether it is some background about the co-organizers or relevant information about past or upcoming courses.

Every page uses a responsive design so it looks good and provides a good UX on any kind of device.
I made a mockup of the pages using Adobe XD (LINK XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX) to guide me through the coding process, but many of the initial ideas were changed or adapted as the project evolved.

These are the user stories that guided the design process:
- As a user, I want to want to know a lot about the backgrounds of PW and Criarte, so I can be sure that this is a high quality course.
- As a user, I want to explore more content from other sources (like social media and external websites), to build up my interest about DBM.
- As a user, I want to know about previous events, so I can decide if this is something that would interest me.
- As a user, I want a fast a simple way to sign up for an event when i make my decision.


## Features

The whole website and its components are responsive to the screen size where it's being viewed.

It consists of:
    - 3 base layouts for the different kinds of pages:
      - Home/landing page
      - Information page
      - Gallery page
    - 2 navigation elements:
      - Top menu to browse through the pages
      - Footer with links to relevant content
  
### These are the existing Features

- Hover effects on menu items, logo and links - to make the navigation easy and visually appealing.
- Clickable icons - to link to external content or send an email.
- Sign up form on the bottom - always accessible to the user when he decides to go forward.
- Gallery show media on hover - on desktop view, user only needs to hover the photo thumbnail to show the full size media.

### These are the features Left to Implement

- Dual language - to make the website available in English and Portuguese.



## Technologies Used

This website was written in HTML and CSS.

Some additional technologies were used to achieve the result:
    - Bootstrap 4.5.2 to facilitate the design ([## Technologies Used](https://getbootstrap.com/))
    - jQuery 3.4.1 for modal form (https://jquery.com/)
    - Fontawesome 5 for icons (https://fontawesome.com/)
    - 






<!-- 


In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
