# Baby Developmental Massage Courses Website

Peter Walker is widely respected and well-known as a teacher of Developmental Baby Massage. Peter has over 40 years experience in giving mother and baby massage groups. His certificated teacher training courses for Developmental Baby Massage are enjoyed by health visitors, nursery nurses, midwives, massage and many other therapists working with mothers and babies.
Criarte is a project about Yoga and events of artistic and pedagogical expression with couples, pregnant women, babies, children, their families and professionals who accompany them.
Peter and Criarte joined forces to make Baby Developmental Massage Courses availabe in Portugal, and this website intends to become an infomation hub about this organization, and promote these events to the local target audience (even though everything is in english for evaluation purposes) and the online events to a global audience.




## UI/UX

This website is made for moms and health professionals. The vast majority of users will be woman, so the color palette chosen is more appealing to the feminine side.

At this stage of development I focused on static elements of information about the courses, so the UI is designed to make all the items very accessible. For most of it the user only needs 1 or 2 clicks to get what he wants, whether it is some background about the co-organizers or relevant information about past or upcoming courses.

Every page uses a responsive design so it looks good and provides a good UX on any kind of device.
I made a mockup of the pages using Adobe XD (located inside the design-files folder on Github) to guide me through the coding process, but many of the initial ideas were changed or adapted as the project evolved.

These are the user stories that guided the design process:
- As a user, I want to want to know a lot about the backgrounds of PW and Criarte, so I can be sure that this is a high quality course.
- As a user, I want to explore more content from other sources (like social media and external websites), to build up my interest about DBM.
- As a user, I want to know about previous events, so I can decide if this is something that would interest me.
- As a user, I want a fast a simple way to sign up for an event when i make my decision.




## Features

It consists of:
    - 3 base layouts for the different kinds of pages:
