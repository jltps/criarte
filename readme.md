## UI/UX

This website is built for health professionals, moms and baby massage enthusiasts. The vast majority of users will be woman, so the color palette, the pictures and all the content elements were picked in the consideration of making the UI appealing to the feminine side.
The font chosen was Rajdhani because it is coherent and blends well with the design, colors and content.

Thoughout the pages there is always a navigation menu present to make the vast ammount of information on the website accessible with only 1 or 2 clicks, and also a footer to link to additional relevant content and a sign up form that is always there for when the user makes up his/her mind to attend to an event.

All the pages are screen size responsive, so the content always adapts and looks orgazined and easy to read in any kind of device.
The content is displayed in various forms like video, photos, texts, tables and cards so that the user can interact in different and not be bored while visiting the website.

A [desing mockup](https://github.com/jltps/criarte/blob/master/design-files/criarte-website-UI-mockup.xd) was built for both mobile and desktop view using Adobe XD to guide me through the coding process, but some of the initial ideas were changed or adapted as the project evolved:
